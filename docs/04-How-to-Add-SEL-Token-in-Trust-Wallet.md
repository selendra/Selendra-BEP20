### How to Add SELToken on Trust Wallet

#### Step 1. Access Search Token Screen

Tap on the toggle sign on the upper right corner of the Wallet Screen. Search for the token, and if the token is not available, you will get a “No Asset Found” screen with the Add Custom Token button.
For Android devices, you can scroll down to the bottom of the list of available tokens and you will see there + Add Custom Token.

#### Step 2. Get Custom Token Information


#### Step 3. Fill up Token Details

Using the information taken from Etherscan, carefully fill up the required Token details. Tap on Done once you are done.

#### Step 4. Token Successfully Added

On the main wallet screen, the token will now appear. Since this is still a new token, the logo as well as the price will not be available. The token has to be trading first and listed on CoinMarketCap 787 before the price can be properly displayed on the App.
