### Connecting MetaMask to Binance Smart Chain

To communicate our metamask to Binance Smart Chain nodes we need to change the network setting as bellow:
1. Navigate to icon account and choose Settings

![Select Settings from the dropdown menu.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6874962/114129914-b687e400-9929-11eb-95e3-bac65470c6b1.png)

2. Add Network 
Click on Add Network at the top-right corner and manually fill the below informations.

- Network Name: Binance Smart Chain
- New RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
- ChainID: 56
- Symbol: BNB
- Block Explorer URL: https://bscscan.com

We’re going to use the testnet in this tutorial, but you will likely want to use the mainnet. We recommend adding both if you intend to use MetaMask to transfer BNB or Binance Smart Chain tokens. 
Once you Save the Network and return to the main view, you’ll notice two things: the network has automatically been set to the one you just entered, and the units are no longer denominated in ETH, but in BNB.

We’ve connected the Mainnet.
